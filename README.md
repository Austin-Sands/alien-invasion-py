# Alien Invasion Py

In alien invasion, you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen. You can move left and right using the arrow keys (or awsd) and shoot using the spacebar.

Once the game starts, aliens will fill the top half of the screen and begin to move across the screen and then down. You must shoot and destroy these aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

You have three lives total and you lose a life for every alien ship that a) hits you or b) reaches the bottom of the screen.

If you can manage to destroy all of the aliens in the wave, a faster wave of reinforcements will appear.
